# Edwin J. Wood ‚Äì Resume / Projects Site

A lightweight, modern personal resume + projects site built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, deployed to GitHub Pages (user site). Uses a HashRouter to avoid refresh 404s.

---

## üîß Install & First Run

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME.github.io.git
cd YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
npm install
git checkout -b dev   # create dev branch if needed
npm run dev
```

Visit the printed local URL (default <http://localhost:5173>).

---

## üß™ Development Workflow

1. Stay on dev while editing.
1. Update resume (`src/Resume.jsx`), projects (`src/Projects.jsx`), and the home business card (`src/App.jsx`).
1. Add routes in `src/App.jsx` (HashRouter in use).
1. Commit changes normally.
1. Deploy using the script (see Deploy section below).

---

## üöÄ Deploy

Production is served from the main branch. Run the script from dev.

Deploy:

```powershell
./deploy.ps1
```

Skip pulling remotes first:

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 -SkipPull
```

Auto-stage/commit when prompted (optional):

```powershell
./deploy.ps1 -AutoCommit
```

URLs:

- User page: <https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/#/>
- Resume page: <https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/#/resume>
- Projects page: <https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/#/projects>
- Filtered view: <https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/#/projects?cat=Automation>

---

## üì¶ Manual Production Build

```powershell
npm run build
```

Outputs go to dist/ (ignored by git). The deploy script selectively copies required files.

Preview the production build locally (no deploy):

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then open the printed URL (default <http://localhost:4173/#/projects>) to validate before pushing. You can also check the resume at <http://localhost:4173/#/resume>.

## üåê Routing Strategy

GitHub Pages can‚Äôt serve SPA history routes. HashRouter keeps the path client-side (#/...). If migrating to Netlify or Vercel you can switch to BrowserRouter and add rewrite rules.

## üß© Customization Guide

| Area | Where | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Resume content | `src/Resume.jsx` | Replace sections / bullet points |
| Home business card | `src/App.jsx` | Edit HomeCard (name, subtitle, layout) |
| Projects list | src/Projects.jsx | Edit the projects array |
| Styles / Theme | tailwind.config.js, index.css | Extend colors, fonts, etc. |
| Card texture | `src/App.css` | Tweak `.paper-texture` / `.paper-card` or remove |
| Favicon | vite.svg | Replace file + link tag |
| SEO Meta | index.html | Update title + description |
| Navigation | `src/App.jsx` | Add `Link` + `Route` |
| Deployment msg | deploy.ps1 | Adjust commit message template |

Dark mode: add `darkMode: 'class'` to tailwind config, toggle `classList` on the html element.

---

## üîç Quality & Accessibility

- Single h1 per view
- Sufficient color contrast
- Keyboard check (Tab through nav)
- Descriptive link text

Behavior notes

- Export PDF button is shown on the Resume page only (hidden on Home and Projects).
- The Home card is fully clickable (opens Resume) and includes quick links in the top-right.

## üîß Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Empty production index.html | Built file copied over source earlier | Restore dev index.html (script tag to /src/main.jsx) then rebuild |
| Dev server points at built bundle | index.html was not restored to dev template | Copy index.dev.html over index.html (or re-run deploy.ps1 which restores it) |
| Old content after deploy | Browser / Pages cache | Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or wait 1‚Äì2 min |
| 404 on deep route (no hash) | Switched to BrowserRouter on Pages | Use HashRouter or move hosting |
| Tailwind classes missing | Purge misconfig / missing directives | Ensure @tailwind base; components; utilities; in index.css |
| Home headshot not showing | Wrong image path | Replace the file at `assets/Headshot.png` or update the import in `src/App.jsx` |

---

## üîÑ Alternative Publication (gh-pages branch)

Prefer not committing build output on main? Publish dist/ to a gh-pages branch via GitHub Action or the gh-pages npm package. (Not used here because a user site root must be built content.)

---

## üìú License

Personal use orientation. Fork and adapt freely for your own resume / portfolio.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Start TL;DR

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME.github.io.git
cd YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
npm install
git checkout -b dev
npm run dev
./deploy.ps1
```

Cheers.
